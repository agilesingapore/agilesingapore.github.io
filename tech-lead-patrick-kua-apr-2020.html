      <h1 class="display-3">Tech Lead Workshop by Patrick Kua</h1>
      <h1>What is it?</h1>

      <p>This two-day Tech Lead workshop is a course for Tech Leads by Tech Leads. This course focuses on technical leadership skills​ for Tech Leads through discussion, theory and practical exercises opposed to general leadership skills​ for Tech Leads. We explore the unique combination of skills and experiences that distinguish a "Tech Lead" from a "Leader working in a technical environment."</p>

      <h1>Who’s it for?</h1>

      <p>A combination between a developer about to lead their first development team, or a Tech Lead for an existing team. This course will be most useful for those with the opportunity to apply their learnings immediately, or to experiences they can relate to.</p>
      

      <h1>What will participant’s learn?</h1>

      <ul>
      <li>What the breadth of the Tech Lead role encompasses</li>
      <li>Why the Tech Lead role is necessary</li>
      <li>What makes the Tech Lead unique from other leadership roles</li>
      <li>What a Technical Vision is and how to shepherd a team towards a Technical Vision</li>
      <li>How to identify and manage Cross Functional Requirements</li>
      <li>How to manage path to production tasks and resources</li>
      <li>How to manage technical risks</li>
      <li>Why relationships matter and how a Tech Lead builds and maintains good relationships with technical and non-technical people</li>
      <li>Different influencing styles</li>
      <li>How to navigate conflict and find a way forward</li>
      </ul>

      <p>Participants will leave the course with a clearer understanding of the role, new tools and mental models for handling Tech Lead responsibilities, experience applying some of these tools with feedback and a network of other Tech Leads to connect with.</p>
      

      <h1>What background should participants have?</h1>

      <p>Participants will have had some experience working on a variety of teams, possibly tried facilitating several meetings and has had some experience with different parts of the software lifecycle (e.g. story writing, build and release infrastructure, development and test, release and/or iteration planning and production support). Ideally they have played a leadership role for at least one team, however even experienced Tech Leads will learns something from this course.</p>
