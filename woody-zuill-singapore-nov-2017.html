          <p>Woody Zuill is well known for his work on <a href="http://mobprogramming.org" target="_blank">Mob Programming</a> and NoEstimates, founded from past experiences working as a software developer. He is a storyteller and a frequent speaker who wants to increase humanity in software development. For those who've attended <a href="http://2016.agilesingapore.org" target="_blank">Agile Singapore 2016 conference</a>, he was invited to speak about Mob Programming and Continuous Discovery. The following are two workshops planned while he is here. We're also organising a community talk on 21 Nov evening (to be announced later). You may find out more about him at his <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/woodyzuill" target="_blank">LinkedIn profile</a>.

          <p>
            This is a volunteer work and any profit will go to Agile Singapore to support future events.

            <p>The default use of an "estimate-driven" approach is pervasive in software development efforts. While estimates can be useful, it is worthwhile to scrutinize our use of estimates, and to seek better ways to manage the development of software when estimates are not appropriate. [NOTE: For this session, I am referring to the use of estimates of cost, time, or effort for software projects, features, or tasks.]
            </p>

            <p>There are a number of things to explore. For example, do we really need estimates for everything we currently use them for? Are we getting a reasonable benefit from them? Is it possible to manage software development without them? 
            </p>

            <p>In this session we will start with an information gathering exercise to help us gain a shared idea of our current understanding of the purpose and use of estimates. From here we'll move on to examine the nature of software development projects and a few possible other ways to approach our work.

            <p>Mob Programming: All the brilliant people working on the same thing, at the same time, in the same place, and on the same computer.
            </p>

            <p>Mob Programming is a cost-effective, collaborative and fun way to get work done together. It's a whole-team approach to development, where coding, designing, testing, and working with the "customer" (partner, Product Owner, User, etc.) is all done as a team.
            </p>

            <p>Participants in this workshop experience a day of learning and doing Mob Programming. We cover the mechanics of how to work together as a Mob as well as the techniques that make this form of development so effective.
            </p>

            <p>We’ll learn how a Mob performs sample project work, including user stories, prioritization, test-driven development, refactoring, and retrospectives.
            </p>

            <p>Designed and facilitated by Mob Programming pioneer Woody Zuill, this workshop provides a hands-on education in the art of mobbing and it's significant benefits for your teams.
