            <p>Technical Debt is a catch-all term that we use for entropy in software development. Systems grow, become unruly, and difficult to work with.
When this happens, we often know that we can do better, but it is hard to take concrete actions which help us get a strong a sense of control over the evolution of an entire code base.
            </p>

            <p>In this course, Michael Feathers will outline what he has learned about making big changes in large software projects. You'll learn techniques all along the continuum of team coordinated refactoring, rewriting, and advanced team practice which help you maximize the potential of your existing code base.
            </p>

            <p><strong>Objectives</strong></p>
            By the end of this course, you will:
            <ul>
              <li>Identify various types of technical debt</li>
              <li>Assess the amount of technical debt in your codebase</li>
              <li>Develop design plans for large-scale refactoring and debt mitigation</li>
              <li>Alter team and organizational process to make refactoring a first-class practice</li>
            </ul>

            <p><strong>Target Audience</strong></p>
            <p>For managers and developers with knowledge of software development. There will be no actual coding in the course, but people must have reading knowledge of code.</p>

            <p><strong>What to bring?</strong></p>
            <p>A laptop computer with text editor.</p>

            <p><strong>Timing</strong></p>
            <p>9am to 4:30pm for both days</p>
          </div>

              <dt>Beyond Error Handling - Using Design to Prevent Errors</dt>

              It would be easy to say that error handling is a black art in software development but that implies that there is some secret stash of knowledge out there. The truth is that we tend to think of error handling as a "lesser concern." If we know how to throw and catch exceptions, we feel that we are okay.
            </p>
            <p>
              The fact of the matter is - we aren't okay. Error handling in applications is often a symptom of incomplete design. This course will focus on techniques you can use to systematically increase the robustness of code by rooting out potential errors and designing them away.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>Topics will include</strong>
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>Survey of Error Handling Mechanisms</li>
              <li>A Model for Robustness</li>
              <li>Trusted Cores and Type Tunneling</li>
              <li>Reducing Variation</li>
              <li>Dealing with Concurrency and Distribution</li>
              <li>Guidance for Exceptions/Null Objects/Options</li>
              <li>Design Inversion</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Workshop Format</strong></p>
            <p>The format of the course is lecture, with team exercises and discussion.</p>

            <p><strong>Target Audience</strong></p>
            <p>This course is for developers. There will be extensive coding exercises. Participants should have experience in Java, C#, or C++.</p>

            <p><strong>What to bring?</strong></p>
            <p>A laptop computer with a Java, C#, or C++ programming environment. The exercises will translated into all of those languages.</p>

            <p><strong>Timing</strong></p>
